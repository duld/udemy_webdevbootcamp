Event Bubbling:
  When you click on an element, it also fires any click events attatched to parent elements.

  To prevent the event bubbling, you must tell the even to stop triggering events.
    do this using: event.stopPropegation();

Adding event listeners to dynamically added elements:
  You add the event listener to the 'container' where the dynamic elements will be added.
  Then, you specify the dynamic element in the jquery addEventListener syntax.

  $('ul').on('click', 'li', function(){});
  // the 'li' argument is what the event listener is checking for when the click event fires.
