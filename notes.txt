Event Bubbling:
  When you click on an element, it also fires any click events attatched to parent elements.

  To prevent the event bubbling, you must tell the even to stop triggering events.
    do this using: event.stopPropegation();

Adding event listeners to dynamically added elements:
  You add the event listener to the 'container' where the dynamic elements will be added.
  Then, you specify the dynamic element in the jquery addEventListener syntax.

  $('ul').on('click', 'li', function(){});
  // the 'li' argument is what the event listener is checking for when the click event fires.


box-shadow
  - offset x, offset y, color

box-sizing
   This fixes the width/height of an element when using width: 100%
   so that the element doesn't extend past the diemensions of its parent,
   if there is also padding or margin applied.

   webkit and moz prefixes must be included.

Using css selectors to animate instead of js
  li:hover span {
    width: 100px;
  }

  when you hover over the li, the style will be applied
  to the span element(s) directly inside the li.

Adding an invisible border
  border: 3px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);

  this is usefull for when you have elements such as an input 
  of type 'text' that causes elements below it to shift when it's 
  under focus. For example in a project if you add a border when you 
  you have the input under focus 


removing an element from a JS array.
  - Don't forget that pop removes the last item in the array, passing an 
    argument will not pop/remove that index from the array.

Section 20: Intro to Backend notes - 


static vs dynamic web pages:
  - dynamic pages are compiled on the server, constructed and then sent
    to the user.

  - static pages do not change, the code that makes the page is constant.

stack: A generic term referring to the technologies used in constructing a 
       website/webapp.


HTTP requests:
  1) An HTTP request is sent to a website's ip address.

  Get - A request form browswer search bar; asking for information back.
   - body: the returned HTML that is sent to the browser
   - headers:

# NODE ##----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Intro to Node:
    What is Node?
      A javascript runtime built on v8 js engine and chakra. It is a non 
      browswer platform that allows you to run javascript files. 

    Why are we learning it?
      Its new and very popular but more importantly its asynchronous, open 
      source, great libraries, high-performance, strong vibrant community. Also 
      you can leverage JS knowledge to learn backend.
    
      Node allows you to run javascript on the server as if you were running 
      python, ruby or any other backend language.
  
  # NPM ##---------------------------------------------------------------------
  What is NPM?
    Node Package Manager (NPM), is a package manager that allows you to install 
    packages; js code that other people have written that you can include in 
    your app.

  Installing and Using Packages:
    Use 'npm install' to install a package
    use 'require()' to include a package
