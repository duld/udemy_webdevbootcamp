Event Bubbling:
  When you click on an element, it also fires any click events attatched to parent elements.

  To prevent the event bubbling, you must tell the even to stop triggering events.
    do this using: event.stopPropegation();

Adding event listeners to dynamically added elements:
  You add the event listener to the 'container' where the dynamic elements will be added.
  Then, you specify the dynamic element in the jquery addEventListener syntax.

  $('ul').on('click', 'li', function(){});
  // the 'li' argument is what the event listener is checking for when the click event fires.


box-shadow
  - offset x, offset y, color

box-sizing
   This fixes the width/height of an element when using width: 100%
   so that the element doesn't extend past the diemensions of its parent,
   if there is also padding or margin applied.

   webkit and moz prefixes must be included.

Using css selectors to animate instead of js
  li:hover span {
    width: 100px;
  }

  when you hover over the li, the style will be applied
  to the span element(s) directly inside the li.

Adding an invisible border
  border: 3px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);

  this is usefull for when you have elements such as an input 
  of type 'text' that causes elements below it to shift when it's 
  under focus. For example in a project if you add a border when you 
  you have the input under focus
